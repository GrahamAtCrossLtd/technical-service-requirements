## Documentation

### As a service:

* I will always document myself in the repository that holds the code
* I will always update documentation in parallel with code changes
* I will have an overarching repository that corresponds to the service that will link to the underlying code repositories for further documentation
* I will add architectural diagrams to the high-level service repository and also corresponding code repositories where applicable

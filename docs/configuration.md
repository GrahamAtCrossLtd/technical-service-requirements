## Configuration

### As a service:

* I will take in environment variables natively to my service
* Any environment specific configuration should be passed in at runtime as environment variable(s) using a mechanism such as 'secrets'
* Any environment specific requirements such as certificates should be passed in to the environment at runtime using a mechanism such as 'secrets'

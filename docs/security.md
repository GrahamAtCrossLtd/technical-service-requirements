## Security

### As a Service, I should: 
- (Follow the guidelines of)[https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/security-guide-for-developers]
- Always use TLS 1.2 encryption to my service and to dependent services, (even datastores)
- Use SSO for users and not hold users locally
- Have a way of providing auditable information on users and the service
- Have authentication / authorization for dependent services where data needs to be protected

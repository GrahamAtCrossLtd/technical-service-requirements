# Technical Service Requirements

### Overview

The aim of this living documentation is to provide an expectation of what is required of our services in terms
of the technical implementation. This is broken up into several documents to clearly document how we want to monitor,
iterate, continuously integrate / deploy and debug our services.

### Contributing

If you feel that there is anything we have missed / incorrectly highlighted, please feel free to change the documentation
and raise a PR for this to be amended.
